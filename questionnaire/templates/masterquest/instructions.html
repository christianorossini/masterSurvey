        The main objective of this research is to expose a set of participants to {{numTasks}} different code snippets and ask his
        opinion about the ocurrence of a code smell type. The
        participant must accomplish {{numTasks}} different tasks, each one will have only a related code snippet. In others tasks
        there will be, besides the code, a decision tree that will serve as a decision aid, or suggestion, to decision
        making.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        Masures:
        <ul>
            <li>The agreement among developers about detection of a code smell type, with or without a decisioin tree aid</li>
            <li>The time required to solve the tasks, with or without a decisioin tree aid</li>
            <li>The confidence of each choose made, with or without a decisioin tree aid</li>
        </ul>
