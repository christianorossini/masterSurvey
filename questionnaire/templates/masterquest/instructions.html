    <h1>2 - Start up instructions</h1>

    <p>
        The participant must accomplish {{numTasks}} different tasks, each one with a related code snippet - a Java
        code. For each
        task, the experiment will suggest the presence of a specific code smell type in the code.
        After a code evaluation, you will be asked to confirm the presence of the suggested code
        smell type in the java code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the experiment, there will be 2 distinct scenarios during code evaluation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> java code evaluation<br>
            The evaluation is based only in Java code structure.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scenario #2:</strong> java code evaluation along with a visual representation of a decision tree
            classifier<br>
            The evaluation is based on a Java code, but, additionally, the experiment will show a decision tree model.
            The tree is composed by nodes (conditional statements) that may help the developer to comprehend the rules
            that
            led the experiment to suggest the presence of certain code smell type.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>About Decision Tree:</p>

    <p>A decision tree is an interpretable machine learning technique that provides a fully understandable way to
        explain
        its predictions (inputs and outputs). In the context of this experiment, the decision tree is built with
        metric-based rules that indicate whether a certain java code is "Smelly code" or "not smelly code". Each node
        has a
        conditional statement that includes a software metric threshold. Take a look at the
        following figure:</p>

    <div class="container-fluid" id="gridModelSnippets" style="width: 40%">
        <figure class="figure">
            <img src="{% get_static_prefix %}masterquest/images/dt/dtExample.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded"
                alt="Decision tree" id="imgDecisionTree" />
        </figure>
    </div>

    <p>As shown in the above example, a method is considered "smelly code" if it satisfies the following conditions:</p>

    <p class="text-center" style="font-style: italic">(Public Methods &le; 4)=FALSE AND (Max Cyclomatic Complexity &le;
        4)=TRUE AND (Maximum nesting level &le; 1)=FALSE</p>

    <p>During experiment execution, there will be a step by step tutorial that explains how to accomplish each part
        of
        the experiment.</p>
