    <p>
        The participant must accomplish {{numTasks}} different tasks, each one with a related code snippet - a Java
        code. For each
        task, the experiment will suggest the presence of a specific code smell type in the code.
        After a code evaluation, you will be asked about your agreement related to the presence of the suggested code
        smell type in the java code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the experiment, there will be 2 distinct scenarios during code evaluation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> java code evaluation without any support<br>
            The evaluation is based only in Java code structure.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> java code evaluation along with a decision tree (an interpretable classifier) support<br>
            The evaluation is based on Java code, but, additionally, the experiment will show a decision tree classifier.
            The tree is composed by nodes based on software metrics thresholds that may help the developer to comprehend the rules that
            led the experiment to suggest the presence of that code smell.
        </li>
    </ul>
