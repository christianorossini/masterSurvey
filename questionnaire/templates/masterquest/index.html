    <h2 id="research-title">Research - Code smell detection aided by a decision tree classifier.</h2>

    <div style="text-indent: 40px">
        <p>Code anomaly, so-called "code smell", is an implementation choice that indicates a design problem that
            violates the well-known principles of cohesion, abstraction and separation of concerns on software
            development. </p>

        <p>
            There is a commonplace about the threats on software quality caused by code smells, at the same time that
            there is a conflicted sense about what is a "smelliness code" though. Code smells and its variants
            are design flaws that stand only in the definition of what it could be, thus every initiative of tracking
            smells on source code is under the influence of a developer's experiences and backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            The subjectiveness around code smells was addressed by recent studies to
            empirically evaluate the opinion of developers about it. These empirical studies were aimed to expose
            developers to software code snippets and gather their point of view about the occurrence of certain types of
            code
            smells, obtaining qualitative results of the agreements among developers.
        </p>

        <p>
            This research is a step ahead to discover agreements among developers, i. e., we intend to expose developers
            to different source code snippets, written in java, along with a decision tree classifier. As an
            interpretable model, this classifier will give insights to developers aimed to serve as a support to
            decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
            So it's relevant to notice that, throughout the survey, part of it will offer
            insights provided by the decision tree (a decision tree visualization) whereas the other part will not. It is expected that these
            different code analysis approaches - with or without support - may influence the decision about the code smell type that affects the source code, 
            changing the way that how similar 2 or more developers detects each type of code smell.
        </p>
