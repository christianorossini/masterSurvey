    <h2 id="research-title">Research - Code smell detection aided by a decision tree classifier.</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Code anomaly, so-called "code smell", is an implementation choice that indicates a deign problem which
            violates the well-known principles of cohesion, abstraction and separation of concerns on software
            development.  </p> 

        <p> Furthermore, there have been many studies proposing to automatically detect bad smells in code. Over the last years,
            Machine learning has been introduced as an important approach to detect code smells. For instance, the
            decision tree is a supervised classifier that has been addressed in many problems involving code smell
            detections, obtaining good effectivity. </p>

        <p>
            The goal of this survey is to aid an empirical research that aims to test the agreement among developers upon 
            certain "smely code", when 
            . It'll test the perception of a participant about a specific code smell type, merged in a java code, and test this
            same perception after a feedback provided by a white box classifier - a decision tree classifier.
